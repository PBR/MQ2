A simple python module to process output from MapQTL analysis.

Assuming one QTL per linkage group and using the LOD threshold set by the user.
This application extracts all the QTLs detected by MapQTL, using the JoinMap
map file, it finds the closest marker and finally put the number of QTLs found
for each marker on the map.

This approach quickly allows you to find potential QTL hotspot in your
dataset. This is particularly usefull for large QTL analysis on a
large number of traits.
