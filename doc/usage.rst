Usage
=====

The command line version of MQ² is ran via the ``MQ2`` command.

Options
~~~~~~~

All the options can be listed via ``MQ2 --help`` or ``MQ2 -h``.

These options are:

- ``-h`` / ``--help``, this will simply present you the list of all the options
  available and what they represent, a little bit like the present document
  but shorter.

- ``-z`` / ``--zipfile``, this is one of the two options to specify to MQ² your
  input files. With this option you are providing to MQ² a zip archive
  containing all the `.mqo` files which were generated by MapQTL during the
  analysis.

- ``-f`` / ``--folder``, this is the second option to specify to MQ² your input
  files. With this option, you are pointing MQ² to a folder containing all the
  `.mqo` files generated by MapQTL during the analysis.

- ``--lod``, this is the option to specify which LOD value from which a QTL is
  considered to be significant. You can run a permutation test in MapQTL to
  determine the optimal LOD threshold to use.

- ``--session``, this is the option that allows you to specify which MapQTL
  session to analyse in your project. Within one MapQTL project, one can
  analyse the same data with different approach or different parameter creating
  a different session each time. The session number you provide to this option
  is the session that you would like to analyse.

- ``--verbose``, this option is mostly of interest to have a more verbose
  output when running MQ².

- ``--debug``, this option is mostly of interest if you are facing a problem
  with MQ². Turn in the option and send us the output in order to improve MQ².


Example commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A basic command of MQ² will look like:

::

 MQ2 --folder /path/to/folder --lod <lod_threshold> --session <mapqtl_session>

For example:

::

 MQ2 --folder c:\Documents\mapqtl\AnalysesB\ --lod 3.2 --session 3


.. note:: MQ2 will generate its output in the current working directory. Be
   aware of this when you run it several time on different dataset or with
   different parameters.
